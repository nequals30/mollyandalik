<strong class="faq-questions">Where should I stay?</strong><br/><br/>
There are many hotel and AirBnB options in Saint Louis, but we recommend booking early as the wedding takes place over a holiday weekend.<br/><br/>
We've arranged a hotel block at Le MÃ©ridien St. Louis Clayton for Friday (6/30) to Sunday (7/2). To book, contact Marriott reservations at (866) 912-4016  and ask for the Moog/Ulmasov wedding block or use <a href="https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1675699378235&key=GRP&app=resvlink">this link</a>. Book by June 1 to receive the block rate of $195 per night. Self parking is $25 and valet is $30 per night.
<br/><br/><br/>

<strong class="faq-questions">Are children invited to the wedding?</strong><br/><br/>
We love your little ones, but our wedding is an adults-only event because of limited capacity at the venue. Please do bring your children to the rehearsal dinner for out-of-town guests and the breakfast the following morning! 
<br/><br/>For childcare, contact <a href="https://tlcforkids.com/find-a-sitter-2/">TLC Family Care</a> by June 1st. They offer one-time appointments for a $40 staffing fee and $17 per hour.
<br/><br/><br/>

<strong class="faq-questions">Do you have a gift registry?</strong><br/><br/>
All we wish for is your presence; no gifts are necessary. We are so thrilled that you are able to make it to our celebration! <br/><br/>
If you would still like to give a gift, please consider contributing to one of your favorite charitable organizations or to one of ours: <a href="https://www.stpatrickcenter.org/">St. Patrick's Center</a> or <a href="https://www.archcitydefenders.org/">Arch City Defenders</a>.
<br/><br/><br/>

<strong class="faq-questions">What should I wear?</strong><br/><br/>
For the wedding, we suggest summer cocktail attire or whatever you feel best in! The wedding will take place in an air-conditioned greenhouse and there will be an outdoor cocktail hour, weather permitting.
<br/><br/> The rehearsal dinner for out-of-town guests and the breakfast are casual.
<br/><br/><br/>

<strong class="faq-questions">How do I get to Urban Chestnut Midtown and where can I park?</strong><br/><br/>
The rehearsal dinner for out-of-town guests will take place in the Barrel Room at the <a href="https://www.urbanchestnut.com/visit/midtown-biergarten">Midtown location</a> of Urban Chestnut brewery, so don't go to the Grove location, or you'll miss out! <br/><br/>

Please park at one of two lots we have reserved across the street at Washington Tabernacle church. We will have signs up for the event.
