<strong class="faq-questions">Where should I stay?</strong><br/><br/>
We've arranged a hotel block at Le Méridien St. Louis Clayton for Friday 6/30 to Sunday 7/2. To book, contact Marriott reservations at (866) 912-4016  and ask for the Moog/Ulmasov Wedding block or use <a href="https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1675699378235&key=GRP&app=resvlink">this link</a>. Book by June 1 to receive the block rate of $195 per night. Le Méridien is located at 7730 Bonhomme in Clayton, and is a 10 minute drive of the Jewel Box. Self parking is $25 and valet is $30 per night. Limited adjoining rooms and suites may be available.<br/><br/>If you select a hotel or a rental outside of the block, we recommend booking early as the wedding takes place over a holiday weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">Are children invited to the wedding?</strong><br/><br/>
We love your little ones, but our wedding is an adults-only event because of limited capacity at the venue. Please do bring your children to the rehearsal for out-of-town guests and the brunch the following morning! For in-town childcare services, contact <a href="https://tlcforkids.com/find-a-sitter-2/">TLC Family Care</a> or <a href="https://www.stlsitter.com/">STL Sitter</a>.<br/><br/> 
TLC Family Care offers one-time childcare appointments for a $40 staffing fee and $17 per hour charge for a minimum of four hours and up to three children. Each additional child beyond three is $1 extra per hour. To book with TLC, fill out the sitter application on their website. They recommend booking by June 1. <br/><br/>
STL Sitter offers childcare for out-of-town guests with a one-time $99 membership fee and $18 per hour rate paid directly to the sitter. To hire STL Sitter go to stlsitter.com and complete the out-of-town guest membership registration, then email them at email@stlsitter.com to complete registration. After that you can book your appointment on their website. They recommend booking by June 3. <br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">Do you have a gift registry?</strong><br/><br/>
We are not registered. No gifts are necessary, as your presence is all that we wish for. We are so thrilled that you are able to make it to our celebration! <br/><br/>
If you would still like to give a gift, please consider contributing to one of your favorite charitable organizations or to one of ours: <a href="https://www.stpatrickcenter.org/">St. Patrick's Center</a>, a non-profit organization that combats homelessness in the Saint Louis area, or <a href="https://www.archcitydefenders.org/">Arch City Defenders</a>, a legal advocacy organization that combats the criminalization of poverty and state violence, especially in communities of color.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">What should I wear?</strong><br/><br/>
For the wedding, we suggest summer cocktail attire or whatever you feel best in! The ceremony and reception will be indoors, and there will be an outdoor cocktail hour, weather permitting. Since the wedding is taking place in an (air-conditioned) greenhouse in July, it could get sunny and hot, so consider dressing in light, comfortable clothing. The rehearsal dinner for out-of-town guests and the brunch are casual. <br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">How do I get to Urban Chestnut Midtown and where can I park?</strong><br/><br/>
The rehearsal dinner for out-of-town guests will take place at the <a href="https://www.urbanchestnut.com/visit/midtown-biergarten">Midtown location</a> of the brewery Urban Chestnut, so don't go to the Grove location, or you'll miss out! 

Please park at one of two parking lots we have reserved for our guests across the street at Washington Tabernacle church: the Washington Lot and the east side of the Locust Lot (the side closest to the church's second building, and accessible through the alley).<br/><br/>

<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">How do I get to the Jewel Box and where can I park?</strong><br/><br/>
The Jewel Box is located at the intersection of McKinley and Wells Drives in Forest Park. A map can be found <a href="https://forestparkmap.org/jewel-box">here</a>. Free parking is available along the sides of McKinley and Wells Drives. We would recommend arriving early since parking in Forest Park is in high demand on summer weekends. Anyone arriving late may have to walk further to the venue. Uber, Lyft, and taxis also operate in Saint Louis, and the venue is directly off the Forest Park bike path (if that's your thing).<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">How do I get to the Turkish Pavilion in Tower Grove Park and where can I park?</strong><br/><br/>
The Turkish pavilion is located in Tower Grove park near the intersection of Center Cross Drive and Southwest Drive. A map of the park can be found <a href="https://www.towergrovepark.org/map">here</a>. Free parking is available throughout Tower Grove Park.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">Is the Jewel Box wheelchair accessible?</strong><br/><br/>
The Jewel Box is a wheelchair accessible venue. Any guests using wheelchairs or with mobility needs can be dropped off at the venue entry. Please reach out to us with any questions about accessibility. Double check with them.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="faq-questions">What is the story behind your invitation?</strong><br/><br/>
Our invitation was designed and illustrated by our extremely talented friend <a href="https://apwestcott.com/">Audrey</a>, who is a graphic designer.<br/>
